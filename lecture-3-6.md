## Longest Common Subsequence

A subsequence of a sequence is obtained by removing zero or more letters from the sequence.

For sequences $A$ and $B$, a sequence is a common subsequence of $A$ and $B$ if it is a subsequence of $A$, and it is a subsequence of $B$.

The problem is to find the longest common subsequence of two sequences $A$ and $B$.
